I have a list of links of songs or albums and won't add it by hand

## how-to

**steps:**\

1. grab your user_id and oauth from [here](https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user/)
2. clone the repo
3. prepare a file of links to songs/albums (mine's named music.txt)
4. download `requests` if you haven't already (`pip install --user requests`)
5. replace file name in `main()`
6. run `python ./main.py` and fill in the secrets when prompted
7. ?
8. profit
